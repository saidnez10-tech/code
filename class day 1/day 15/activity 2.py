# Step 1: Define a function cube(number) that returns the number multiplied by itself three times.
def cube(number):
    return number**3
# Step 2: Define a function by_three(number) that checks if the number is divisible by 3.
def by_three(number):
    if number % 3==0:
        return cube(number)
    else:
        return False
print(by_three(4))
print(by_three(9))
# Step 3: If it is divisible by 3, call and return cube(number) from inside by_three().

# Step 4: If it is not divisible by 3, return False instead.

# Step 5: Call by_three(9) and by_three(4), and print both results.
