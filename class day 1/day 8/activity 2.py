# 1) Ask the user to enter the numerator and store it in `numn`.
numn=int(input("enter numerator"))
# 2) Ask the user to enter the denominator and store it in `numd`.
numd=int(input("enter denominator"))
# 3) Check if `numn` is divisible by `numd`:
if numn%numd==0:
    print("number is divisible")
else:print("number is not divisible")
#    - Find the remainder when `numn` is divided by `numd`.
#    - If the remainder is 0, it means perfectly divisible.

# 4) If divisible, print that `numn` is divisible by `numd`.

# 5) Otherwise, print that `numn` is not divisible by `numd`.
