# Step 1: Start a try block.
try:
    number=int(input("enter a number"))
# Step 2: Inside it, ask the user to enter a number and convert it to an integer using int(input(...)).
    print(number)
except ValueError:
    print("You have not entered a number")
# Step 3: Print the number that was entered.

# Step 4: Add an except ValueError as ex block to catch invalid, non-numeric input.

# Step 5: Inside the except block, print "Exception:" followed by the caught exception object, ex, showing Python's own error message.
